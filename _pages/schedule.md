## Location
The workshop will be held at the "Altes Hauptgebäude" of the TU Darmstadt (S1|03) in room "015".

## 09:00 CEST -- Welcome
The first 30 minutes is about getting together to know each other and talking about the expectations for the workshop. 

## 09:30 CEST -- Inspiration
We will start the workshop with an inspiring session that sets up the remainder of the workshop. 
We will see invited talks, presentations of position papers and -- depending on the number of accepted submissions -- engage in a yet to be decided activity to get into the right mindset. 

## 11:00 CEST -- Interactive I ("Exploration")
We want to establish a common understanding of the key challenges in current AV-VRU research. We will revise open questions from submitted workshop papers to derive topics for a break-out session. The participants will be split into multiple groups that discuss a topic. Possible subjects might be:
* What are the main blockers hindering researchers to collaboratively work with PSN?
* How can we better include PSN into development and design?
* What are inclusive designs in the automotive context that can leverage today’s advanced technology to support PSN?

## 14:00 CEST -- Interactive II ("Consolidating")
After an energizer, we will prioritize the identified challenges and discuss ways towards solutions. 
The relevance of each research opportunity/challenge will be discussed in a plenum.

## 16:00 CEST -- Wrap-Up and Next Steps 
The goal of this workshop is to reach a common understanding of research gaps and opportunities as well as requirements for inclusive AV-VRU interaction.
The last part is dedicated to wrapping up the workshop’s outcomes, plan the next steps, and discuss where to publish possible results.
We want to formulate a research agenda to support initiatives in research and practice to strengthen the accessibility of today’s and future automotive designs

## After the workshop
The discussion on the next steps can, of course, be continued after the workshop, e.g. in our Slack group. 
Depending on the attendee's preferences, we may go out for a shared dinner together.
